# Mini Project - Iris Classifier

This is a simple **machine learning classifier** built using the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).  
The goal of this project was to practice **data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** in Python with scikit-learn.

## Features
- Loads the Iris dataset (via `sklearn.datasets`)
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a simple classifier (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluates model accuracy on test data
- Prints classification results
